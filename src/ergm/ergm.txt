      - Structural Effects:
          - asymmetric: Adds one network statistic to the model equal to the number
            of pairs of actors for which exactly one of (i,j) or (j,i) exists.
          - ctriple: Adds one statistic to the model, equal to the number of cyclic
            triples in the network, defined as a set of edges of the form {(i,j),
            (j,k), (k,i)}.
          - ttriple: Adds one statistic to the model, equal to the number of
            transitive triples in the network, defined as a set of edges {(i,j),
            (j,k), (i,k)}.

    Twitter Activities. PLOS ONE, 11(11), e0166586.
    doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0166586
      - Structural Effects:
          - edgecov: Adds one statistic to the model, equal to the sum of the
            covariate values for each edge appearing in the network.

      - Structural Effects:
          - mutal: In binary ERGMs, equal to the number of pairs of actors i
            and j for which (i,j) and (j,i) both exist.
          - gwesp(decay = 0.5, fixed = TRUE): This term adds one network
            statistic to the model equal to the geometrically weighted dyadwise
            shared partner distribution with decay parameter decay parameter,
            which should be non-negative.
          - edgecov: Adds one statistic to the model, equal to the sum of the
            covariate values for each edge appearing in the network.

      - Structural Effects:
          - mutual: In binary ERGMs, equal to the number of pairs of actors i
            and j for which (i,j) and (j,i) both exist.
          - gwesp(0.1, fixed = TRUE): This term is just like gwdsp except it
            adds a statistic equal to the geometrically weighted edgewise (not
            dyadwise) shared partner distribution with decay parameter decay
            parameter, which should be non-negative.
          - gwdsp(0.1, fixed = TRUE): This term adds one network statistic to the
            model equal to the geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partner 
            distribution with decay parameter decay parameter, which should be
            non-negative.
          - edgecov: Adds one statistic to the model, equal to the sum of the
            covariate values for each edge appearing in the network.

Tips:
  - Check descriptives to specify structural terms
  - Increase sample size -> increase computation time
  - Decrease sample size -> model will run forever cannot fit model
  - Always specify iterations
