  abstract  = "This volume is a foundational resource on the study of networks
               in politics. It is grounded in the understanding that networks
               are omnipresent in the natural and social worlds, and they are
               at the heart of politics. The 43 essays in this volume offer
               instruction on network theory and methods at beginning and
               advanced levels; they also provide an assessment of the
               state-of-the-discipline on a variety of applied network topics
               in politics. Leading scholars in the field address key questions
               in political science such as: Why do people vote? How can
               governments foster innovations? How can countries build ties
               that promote peace? What are the most fruitful strategies for
               disrupting arms or terrorist networks? In answering these
               questions, the volume provides both a summary of the state of
               the field and a roadmap for moving forward.",
